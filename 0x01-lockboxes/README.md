Lockboxes
In this task, we are given a list of boxes, where each box may contain keys to other boxes. The goal is to determine if all the boxes can be opened, starting from the first box.

Solution Overview
To solve this task, we use a set of available keys and a list to keep track of the boxes that have been opened. We start with the first box and add its contents (keys) to the set of available keys. We then loop through the available keys, opening the boxes that correspond to them, and adding their keys to the set of available keys. We continue this process until we either open all boxes or no more boxes can be opened.

Algorithm
Initialize a list of unlocked boxes unlocked, with unlocked[0] set to True, and a set of available keys keys, with the keys from the first box.
While keys is not empty:
a. Remove a key from keys using pop().
<!-- b. If the box corresponding to the key has not been opened yet (unlocked[key] == False), set it to True in unlocked, and add the keys from that box to keys. -->
Check if all boxes have been opened by using the all() function on unlocked.
Return True if all boxes are opened, else False.
Pseudo Code
python
Copy code
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    <!-- n = len(boxes)
    unlocked = [False] * n
    unlocked[0] = True
    keys = set(boxes[0]) -->

    while keys:
        key = keys.pop()
        if not unlocked[key]:
            unlocked[key] = True
            keys.update(boxes[key])
    
    return all(unlocked)
Complexity Analysis
Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of boxes, and m is the total number of keys in all boxes.
Space complexity: O(n), for the list unlocked.
Usage
The function canUnlockAll takes a list of lists as input, where each inner list represents a box, and each element in the list represents a key to another box. The function returns True if all the boxes can be opened, else False.

Copy code
<!-- >>> boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
>>> canUnlockAll(boxes)
True

>>> boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
>>> canUnlockAll(boxes)
True

>>> boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
>>> canUnlockAll(boxes)
False -->
Conclusion
In this task, we learned how to use a set of available keys and a list to keep track of opened boxes, to determine if all boxes can be opened. The solution has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of boxes, and m is the total number of keys in all boxes.
